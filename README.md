# Biome
You can add and remove lists through BiomeData.yml, which exists in the plugin data folder.

Manage in the form of an array and create in the form of - pos1, pos2, world name, biome type.
```
ex)
- ["0 0 0", "100 100 100", "world", "taiga"]
- ["200 200 200 200", "101 101 101", "world", "swamp"]
- 路路路路
```

There are ocean, places, mountains, forest, taiga, swamp, river, hell, ice_plains, small_mountains, birch_fost.

The type of biome must be entered in English and does not matter the case.
